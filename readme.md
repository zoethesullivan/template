## Description
One to two paragraphs about the project: What is this project about? What does the project do? Why is it useful? What problem does it solve? Who is it for?

## Getting Started



### Prerequisites and Main Dependencies


* Node
* TailwindCSS
* Hugo Extended


### Installation

How do you install the project and what do you need for it? Mention all dependencies that need to be installed first. Ideally, you also provide version numbers. (I’m looking at you, Node.js…)

Example:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/username/repository
```

## Usage

Instructions for how to configure, run, and use the project. For example, you can include the commands needed to install and start the development environment or any other useful and important commands. Screenshots can be included as well.

_For more examples and usage, please refer to the [Documentation](https://github.com/username/yourproject/wiki)._

## Testing 

Any unit or integration tests people can run to assure that everything’s working as expected? Any frameworks or commands that are needed here? And are there any tests in your deployment pipeline that ensure that no errors make it into the live site?

Also include the commands needed to run any tests:

```sh
npm run test
```

## Deployment

Instructions for how to deploy the project to a production environment, including any server requirements and commands used. And, in case you are using a CI/CD pipeline, for example, how do any automated processes work? What are the most important branches? Do they trigger any pipelines?

## additionalreadmeaddons

Note: These add-on's are here for other readme documentaion that might have more design focused needs.

### Requirements for a Standard README

  - Be called README.md (with capitalization).
  - If the project supports i18n, the file must be named accordingly: `README.de.md`, where `de` is the BCP 47 Language tag. For naming, prioritize non-regional subtags for languages. If there is only one README and the language is not English, then a different language in the text is permissible without needing to specify the BCP tag: e.g., `README.md` can be in German if there is no `README.md` in another language. Where there are multiple languages, `README.md` is reserved for English.
  - Be a valid Markdown file.
  - Sections must appear in order given below. Optional sections may be omitted.
  - Sections must have the titles listed below, unless otherwise specified. If the README is in another language, the titles must be translated into that language.
  - Must not contain broken links.
  - If there are code examples, they should be linted in the same way as the code is linted in the rest of the project.
